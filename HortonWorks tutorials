## Introduction

The Sandbox is a straightforward, pre-configured, learning environment that contains the latest developments from Apache Hadoop, specifically the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). 

HDF - is used to handle Data in Motion
HDP - is used to handle Data at Rest
But HDP contains storm (real time message processing) and Kafka ( distributed messaging system ).


### Steps for Environment Setup
1. Determine Network Adapter of the Sandbox:

###Network Address Translation(NAT)
By default, the VM attaches to Network Address Translation (NAT) network mode.
The guest’s IP address by default translates over to the host’s IP address.
NAT allows for the guest system to connect to external devices on external networks, but external devices cannot access the guest system.

2. Bridged Networking
